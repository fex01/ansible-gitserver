## Intro
### Why?
To have a repeatable and versionable cooking receipt for setting up servers sounds quite sexy, so even if it might be a bit of a overkill for private users, I got quite intrigued by [Ansible][ansible-intro].

Since the best way to learn something is
1. to use it
2. to teach<sup id="a1">[1](#f1)</sup> it

I decided to take an existing [work log][worklog], to turn it into an Ansible play and to document what I did.



### Tools & Platform
* machine with Ansible: running [Ubuntu 18.04 LTS](https://ubuntu.com)<sup id="a2">[2](#f2)</sup>
* target: [Raspberry Pi 3 Model B](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-3-model-b/)<sup id="a3">[3](#f3)</sup>
* target OS: [Raspbian Buster Lite](https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspbian/)
* server administration tool: [Ansible 2.9][ansible-intro]



### What am I trying to achieve?
The aim is to take a fresh Raspbian installation, do some hardening, install git and have a ready to use private Git server. The details on how I did that manually you can find in said [work log][worklog], the steps break down to:
* change username pi to a custom username
* change the default password
* require password for sudo<sup id="a4">[4](#f4)</sup>
* change default hostname
* SSH hardening
* auto updates
* install and configure firewall ([ufw](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncomplicated_Firewall))
* install & configure vim (optional, it's just my preferred editor)
* install & configure git
* create additional user git
* restrict user git to git shell
* clone repos from backup



## Preparation
If not stated otherwise all steps have to be done on your Ansible machine, not on the target.



### Prepare your Raspberry Pi
* download Raspbian Lite https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/
* write image on SD card https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/installation/installing-images/README.md
    * `touch /Volumes/boot/ssh`<sup id="a5">[5](#f5)</sup> enable SSH by writing an empty file called `ssh` on the boot partition<sup id="a6">[6](#f6)</sup>
    * eject & insert SD card into your Raspi
    * connect your Raspberry Pi to LAN and power
* if missing, generate ssh public key on your Ansible machine: `ssh-keygen -o`
* if you are repeating the setup process delete old host keys
    * delete old host key (name): `ssh-keygen -f "/home/<username>/.ssh/known_hosts" -R "raspberrypi"`
    * delete old host key (IP): `ssh-keygen -f "/home/<username>/.ssh/known_hosts" -R "xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx"`
* copy ssh public key to your Pi (password raspberry): `ssh-copy-id pi@raspberrypi`



### Install Ansible
The following steps are for Ubuntu, for details / other OSs have a look into the [Ansible docs][ansible-install].
* `sudo apt update`
* `sudo apt install software-properties-common`
* `sudo apt-add-repository --yes --update ppa:ansible/ansible`
* `sudo apt install ansible`
* `sudo apt install python3-argcomplete`
* `sudo activate-global-python-argcomplete3`



### Prepare Work Environment 
* create an empty folder, e.g. ansible-gitserver, and cd into said folder
* `git clone https://github.com/fex01/ansible-gitserver.git ./`
* download required public roles `ansible-galaxy install -r requirements.yml --role-path ./roles/` into 'working directory/roles'



### Network Stuff
Recommendation: Assign a permanent IP address to your Raspi, probably done via your router. Example for a [AVM FRITZ!Box](https://en.avm.de/service/fritzbox/fritzbox-7590/knowledge-base/publication/show/201_Configuring-FRITZ-Box-to-always-assign-the-same-IP-address-to-a-network-device/):
* open a browser, open the Web GUI of your router, address might be something like 'http://192.168.xxx.1'
* log in with an admin account
* Home Network -> Network (German GUI says 'Heimnetz -> Netzwerk')
* click the 'Edit' button for the device 'raspberrypi'
* activate the appropriate option, should be something like 'Always assign the same IPv4 address to this network device'
* click 'OK' to save your changes
* since the device is identified by it's MAC address, it doesn't matter that we will rename our Raspi later and it will also not matter if you insert a different SD Card with an different image into your Raspi



## Getting Started
### Minimal Configuration
For a first test run it's enough to open your ansible-gitserver working directory and change the following values:
* `working_directory/group_vars/all.yml/ssh_public_keys` - public SSH key of your ansible machine
* `working_directory/group_vars/szczecin.yml/location_subnet` - network prefix of your LAN
* `working_directory/group_vars/gitserver.yml/ansible_host` - IP address of your Raspi



### Run Ansible
Having done that you could now start the setup process with the following command (default vault password is 'my_secret_password')
```
ansible-playbook gitserver.yml -i ./hosts --vault-id git@prompt
```

Ansible will now execute the playbook and you can watch while a not to short list of tasks will be finished.
And voil√†, you have a ready to use private Git server. Credentials are as following:
* system account
    * name: link
    * password: my_secret_password
* git account
    * name: git
    * password: my_secret_password



### Setting up a Repository on your new Server
You might want to actually have some repos on your Git server, lets say you want my ansible-gitserver repo on your private server:
* `ssh link@git` ssh into your Git server with the system account
* `cd ../git/` change into user gits homefolder
* `sudo git clone --bare https://github.com/fex01/ansible-gitserver.git ansible-gitserver.git` we clone the repo with the `--bare` option, for details why let me point you to the relevant chapter of the free online book [Pro Git][git-server]
* `sudo chown -R git:git ansible-gitserver.git` make the user git the owner of this repo
* `exit` end your SSH connection

Now what do we have to do on our ansible machine to use our Git server as remote? Let's have a look at two different options:
* clone a fresh copy of the repo from our private server
    * leave your ansible-gitserver working directory and navigate to where you want the new copy
    * `git clone ssh://git@git/home/git/ansible-gitserver.git ansible-gitserver-private`
    * done, `git push` and `git pull`commands will use your private server as target
* add a second remote to our existing ansible-gitserver working directory
    * `git remote add private ssh://git@git/home/git/ansible-gitserver.git`
    * done, `git remote show` will now show two remotes for this repo, origin & private
    * with `git remote show origin` or `git remote show private` you can test the connection to the remote and see details like the remotes URL

While this test run was nice to see that Ansible actually does the job, **I would strongly counsel against using your new server at it is - you are still using user names & passwords chosen by me**!
Let's have a look at the next chapter to change that.



## Getting Useful
An Ansible based setup process would not be very useful if you couldn't change my default values for stuff like user names, passwords, port numbers, etc. ... - thats where Variables come into play. To understand where to set them, we need some common terms.



### Ansible Speak
I aim to keep the vocabulary lessons to a minimum, but lets have a look at two key concepts:



#### Inventory
A list of computers managed by Ansible, sorted into groups (details see [Ansible - How to build your inventory][ansible-inventory]).
As example a commented 'hosts' file:
```
# working_directory/hosts
 
[berlin_raspbian]               

[szczecin_gitserver]             # group
git                              # a managed computer, called host

[szczecin_raspbian]              # different group
git                              # same host

# gitserver in all locations
[gitserver:children]             # group of groups
szczecin_gitserver

# raspbian installations in all locations
[raspbian:children]              # different group of groups
berlin_raspbian
szczecin_raspbian

# everything in berlin
[berlin:children]
berlin_raspbian

# everything in szczecin
[szczecin:children]
szczecin_gitserver
szczecin_raspbian
```
As you can see I have grouped my hosts by location (berlin & szczecin), by function (gitserver) and by OS (raspbian). This enables me to link them with variables based on groups, more about that in [Variables](#variables). 



#### Playbooks
The previous mentioned repeatable cooking receipts - on which machine(s) do you want to execute which tasks and what are the environment parameters (details see [Ansible - About Playbooks][ansible-playbooks]).
Example: gitserver.yml
```yml
# working_directory/gitserver.yml

- name: playbook to set up a git server     # name of your play
  hosts: gitserver                          # group of machines to which to apply this play
  gather_facts: false                       # \
  debugger: on_failed                       # - optional parameters
  become: true                              # / 

  tasks:                                    # list of tasks
  - include_role: 
    name: prepare-raspberry
  - include_role: 
    name: gitserver-config
```



### Variables
Comming back to variables - while Ansibles knows a number of options where to set them (details see [Ansible - Using Variables][ansible-variables]), the basic option is to link them to machines in your [Inventory](#inventory). 
Our target is named 'git' and a member of the groups 'szczecin-gitserver', 'szczecin-raspbian', 'gitserver', 'raspbian', 'szczecin' and the special group 'all', which means the variables for all these groups (called group_vars) and the variables for our target (called host_vars) apply. And if you followed [Set IP Address Variables](#set-ip-address-variables), you actually already know where to find them:
* group_vars: `working_directory/group_vars/<group name>.yml`
* host_vars: `working_directory/host_vars/<host name>.yml`

For an individualized Git server I would recommend to set at least the following variables, for more options look into the variable files (for how to encrypt variables see comments for /group_vars/gitserver.yml/user_password_hash):
```yml
# working_directory/group_vars/all.yml

#default system user
ansible_user:

# List your SSH keys here, one per line.
ssh_public_key:
```
```yml
# working_directory/group_vars/raspbian.yml

# system user name
user_name:
```
```yml
# working_directory/group_vars/gitserver.yml

# hostname will change during bootstrapping, provide IP address
ansible_host:
# custom SSH port
# password for system user
# create: 
#   * create hash: ansible all -i localhost, -m debug -a "msg={{ 'my_secret_password' | password_hash('sha512') }}"
#   * encrypt hash: ansible-vault encrypt_string --vault-id git@prompt --stdin-name 'user_password_hash'
# use in play: ansible-playbook¬†<playbook>.yml --vault-id git@prompt
user_password_hash:
# custom SSH port
ssh_port:
# password for the dedicated git user
git_os_user_password_hash:
# username for git commits
git_commit_user_name:
# user email for git commits
git_commit_user_email:
```
Additionally my play has the option to have Ansible import repos from a backup location. For that follow the instructions in the comments and set the following variables (after initial import the private key will be deleted from the new Git server, you have to delete the public key manually from your backup machine<sup id="a7">[7](#f7)</sup>):
```yml
# working_directory/group_vars/gitserver.yml

# [optional] create private / public key pair: ssh-keygen -o
# make public key available on existing git machine (e.g. a backup machine)
# copy content of the private key file and encrypt it
git_private_key:
# git repos on an existing git machine
# example:
#    - repo: ssh://link@{{ location_subnet }}.xxx/path/to/repo/ansible.git
#      dest: /home/git/repos/ansible.git
#      bare: true
git_repositories:
```

Disclaimer: I ignore variable precedence in my explanations (if you set the same variable in multiple location, for example group_vars & host_vars, which value applies?), please look that up at [Ansible - Variable precedence: Where should I put a variable?][ansible-precedence].



### Going back to Start
What? After having finally a running Git server? Yes, but don't worry, it's quite easy. Just repeat the steps of [Prepare your Raspberry Pi](#prepare-your-raspberry-pi) and you are ready to go again.



### And Finish
And now everything you have to do to get a brand new individualized Git server running is executing the following command (remember to enter *your* encryption password when asked):
```
ansible-playbook gitserver.yml -i ./hosts --vault-id git@prompt
```
Done - but this time you have your own individualized Git server :-)  
That also concludes my chapters regarding setting up your own Git server - the next chapters focus more on how to work with Ansible.



## Deep Dive
This chapter will look into whats actually happening when you execute your playbook, explain on a general level how [Roles](#roles) are structured and then take a dive into the roles we use for this project.



### Execution Command
Lets start with the command we are executing: `ansible-playbook gitserver.yml -i ./hosts --vault-id git@prompt`
* `ansible-playbook gitserver.yml` execute playbook 'gitserver.yml'
* `-i ./hosts` use the file 'hosts' in the current directory as inventory
* `--vault-id git@prompt` this play has encrypted variables, ask me for the decryption password, password hint is 'git'



### Roles
Instead of writing the same tasks again and again for different playbooks, you can bundle tasks into roles (details see [Ansible - Roles][ansible-roles]). But the biggest advantage of roles is that they are sharable - just have a look at [Ansible Galaxy][ansible-galaxy] to find roles for almost all common tasks.  
The default structure of roles is
```
my-role/        # folder name is the same as the roles name
  tasks/        # one to multiple task files       
  handlers/     # actions that react on notifications
  files/        # resources
  templates/    # Jinja2 templates
  vars/         # variables with high precedence, should normally not be overwritten
  defaults/     # default values, overwritten by values linked to your inventory
  meta/         # meta information for Ansible Galaxy
  README.md     # readme explaining function and usage of the specific role
```
If you have a look into the roles in *working_directory/roles/*, you will see that not all roles have all folders. That's no trouble, if a specific role doesn't need, for example, additional resources than the role doesn't need a *files* folder. A prime example of that is my *prepare-raspberry* role - in that folder you will only find the *meta* folder and the *README.md* file.  
On the other hand your role might have additional folder, for example for testing. An example of that would be my *gitserver-config* role with the added folder *molecule* (more about testing and Molecule in [Testing](#testing)).  
If you take an existing role, e.g. from [Ansible Galaxy][ansible-galaxy], the way to customize role execution is by overwriting default variables in *role_name/default/main.yml*, for example by having the same variable name with a customized value in your group_vars. An example in this project would be *user_name*. You will find that variable in *working_directory/roles/prepare-raspberry/defaults/main.yml*, but since the variable is also set in *working_directory/group_vars/gitserver.yml* the default value will be overwritten by whatever you set in *working_directory/group_vars/gitserver.yml* (details about precedence see [Ansible - Variable precedence: Where should I put a variable?][ansible-precedence]).  
To avoid ambiguity - you don't change anything inside the roles folder. You overwrite role defaults by having the same variable_name linked to your inventory.

You might remember from [Playbooks](#playbooks), that our play include two roles, [Role prepare-raspberry](#role-prepare-raspberry) and [Role gitserver-config](#role-gitserver-config), so lets have a look what they actually do.



### Role prepare-raspberry
After explaining roles in theory - we will start with a role that has not so much to do with standard roles.
> [prepare-raspberry/README.md](https://github.com/fex01/ansible-gitserver/blob/master/roles/prepare-raspberry/README.md)
>
> Bootstrap and customize a Raspbian Lite system. To achieve that this role is using a bunch of subroles.
> 
> It will:
>   * rename the default user *pi* to *user_name*
>   * set a new user password *user_password*
>   * rename the home dir */home/{{ user_name_old }}* to */home/{{ user_name_new }}*
>   * create a symlink */home/{{ user_name_old }}* linking to */home/{{ user_name_new }}*
>   * change the hostname to *host_name*
>   * configure locale
>   * set timezone to *localization_timezone*
>   * activate auto-updates / -upgrades
>   * install and configure vim
>   * set sensible defaults for the SSH server
>   * write public SSH keys to *user_name*'s *authorized_keys* file
>   * install and configure a firewall (ufw)
>
> [...]

Seems like this role is doing quite a lot of different stuff? Well, not quite - actually *prepare-raspberry* is nothing more than a wrapper for a number of different subroles, called dependencies ([Ansible - Role Dependencies][ansible-dependencies]).  
So the role *prepare-raspberry* is not exactly necessary, it's just a convenient way to wrap a number of common roles for a Raspberry installation into one role.  
A look into the role folder shows what that means:
```
# working_directory/roles/

prepare-raspberry/
  defaults/
  meta/
  README.md
```
*prepare-raspberry* does not even have a *tasks* folder, all 'functionality' is contained in the dependencies section of the meta file:
```yml
# prepare-raspberry/meta/main.yml

[...]

dependencies:
  # List your role dependencies here, one per line. Be sure to remove the '[]' above,
  # if you add dependencies to this list.
    - role: set-connection-parameters
      vars:
        connection_custom_port: "{{ ssh_port }}"
        connection_custom_user: "{{ user_name }}"
    - role: provision-root
      vars:
        root_key: "{{ ssh_public_keys | first }}"
    - role: rename-user
      vars:
        user_name_new: "{{ user_name }}"
        user_ignore_connection_errors: true
    - role: rename-host
      vars:
        host_reboot: true
    - role: arillso.localization
      vars:
        localization_timezone_linux: "{{ localization_timezone¬†}}"
    - role: weareinteractive.apt
    - role: GROG.reboot
    - role: manala.vim
    - role: weareinteractive.users
      vars:
        users:
          - username: "{{ user_name }}"
            authorized_keys: "{{ ssh_public_keys }}"
    - role: ssh-server-config
    - role: weareinteractive.ufw
```
To see what's actually done we have to dive deeper into the dependencies.

### Role gitserver-config
> [gitserver-config/README.md](https://github.com/fex01/ansible-gitserver/blob/master/roles/gitserver-config/README.md)
> 
> Create a dedicated user for git operations, install git & clone your repos.
> 
> It will
> * create an non-sudo user {{ git_os_user_name¬†}}
>   * shell restricted to git-shell and without interactive login
>   * provisioned with authorized keys
>   * provisioned with a private key for initial cloning
>   * with restricted SSH access (no-port-forwarding,no-X11-forwarding,no-agent-forwarding,no-pty)
> * add a second user {{ user_name }} without special restrictions to group {{ git_os_user_name }}
> * install and configure git
> * clone specified repos (make sure that the source accepts the private key)
> * deletes the private key after cloning (the idea is that, after initial cloning, your git server should not be able to access your backup source)

## Testing








## TODO
* require password for sudo - probably easy, but I still have to find out how to deal with required sudo passwords in Ansible :sweat_smile:
* automate testing -> automate builds (travis?)
* find / create a fitting Raspbian test image for Docker (seems to be non-trivial because of the underlying ARM architecture :thinking:)
* replacing more of my custom roles with public roles from [Ansible Galaxy][ansible-galaxy]
* publishing my surviving roles on [Ansible Galaxy][ansible-galaxy]
    * move each role into it's own repo (necessary for publishing said role)
    * integrate them as dependencies / subrepos into this repo



## Sources
* [Ansible docs][ansible-intro]
* a role which I could not fit exactly to my purpose but which really helped with getting me started: [hannseman.raspbian](https://github.com/hannseman/ansible-raspbian)
* the code from [moodlebox](https://github.com/moodlebox/moodlebox) was quite helpful vor renaming the default user via Ansible
* Ansibles roles repo [Ansible Galaxy](https://galaxy.ansible.com) in general - just have a look into the source code of different roles to learn
* Jeff Geerlings [Testing your Ansible roles with Molecule](https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2018/testing-your-ansible-roles-molecule) (post is from 2028, installation instructions are not up to date, but it helps with getting the concept)
* [Molecule docs](https://molecule.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
* my git server [work log][worklog]

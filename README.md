# Ansible Git Server
An example using Ansible to set up a private Git server on a Raspberry Pi.



## Intro
### Why?
To have a repeatable and versionable cooking receipt for setting up servers sounds quite sexy, so even if it might be a bit of a overkill for private users, I got quite intrigued by [Ansible][ansible-intro].

Since the best way to learn something is
1. to use it
2. to teach[^disclaimer] it

I decided to take an existing [work log][worklog], to turn it into an Ansible play and to document what I did.

### Tools & Platform
* machine with Ansible: running [Ubuntu 18.04 LTS](https://ubuntu.com)[^ansible-machine]
* target: [Raspberry Pi 3 Model B](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-3-model-b/)[^raspi]
* target OS: [Raspbian Buster Lite](https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspbian/)
* server administration tool: [Ansible 2.9][ansible-intro]

### Steps to Take
(for details see [work log][worklog])
* change username pi to a custom username
* change the default password
* change default hostname
* SSH hardening
* auto updates
* install and configure firewall ([ufw](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncomplicated_Firewall))
* install & configure vim (optional, it's just my preferred editor)
* install & configure git
* create additional user git
* restrict user git to git shell
* clone repos from backup



## Preparation
If not stated otherwise all steps have to be done on your Ansible machine, not on the target.

### Prepare your Raspberry Pi
* download Raspbian Lite https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/
* write image on SD card https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/installation/installing-images/README.md
    * `touch /Volumes/boot/ssh`[^mounting_point] enable SSH by writing an empty file called `ssh` on the boot partition[^etcher]
    * eject & insert SD card into your Raspi
    * connect your Raspberry Pi to LAN and power
* if missing, generate ssh public key on your Ansible machine: `ssh-keygen -o`
* if you are repeating the setup process delete old host keys
    * delete old host key (name): `ssh-keygen -f "/home/<username>/.ssh/known_hosts" -R "raspberrypi"`
    * delete old host key (IP): `ssh-keygen -f "/home/<username>/.ssh/known_hosts" -R "xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx"`
* copy ssh public key to your Pi (password raspberry): `ssh-copy-id pi@raspberrypi`

### install Ansible
The following steps are for Ubuntu, for details / other OSs have a look into the [Ansible docs][ansible-install].
* `sudo apt update`
* `sudo apt install software-properties-common`
* `sudo apt-add-repository --yes --update ppa:ansible/ansible`
* `sudo apt install ansible`
* `sudo apt install python3-argcomplete`
* `sudo activate-global-python-argcomplete3`

### prepare work environment 
* create an empty folder, e.g. ansible-gitserver, and cd into said folder
* `git clone https://github.com/fex01/ansible-gitserver.git ./`
* download required public roles `ansible-galaxy install -r requirements.yml` (default installation path '/etc/ansible/roles')

### network stuff
Recommendation: Assign a permanent IP address to your Raspi, probably done via your router. Example for a [AVM FRITZ!Box](https://en.avm.de/products/fritzbox/):
* open a browser, open the Web GUI of your router, address might be something like 'http://192.168.xxx.1'
* log in with an admin account
* Home Network -> Network (German GUI says 'Heimnetz -> Netzwerk')
* click the 'Edit' button for the device 'raspberrypi'
* activate the appropriate option, should be something like 'Always assign the same IPv4 address to this network device'
* click 'OK' to save your changes
* since the device is identified by it's MAC address, it doesn't matter that we will rename our Raspi later and it will also not matter if you insert a different SD Card with an different image into your Raspi



## Get Started
### Set IP Address Variables
For a first test run it's enough to open your ansible-gitserver working directory and change the following values:
* group_vars/all.yml/ssh_public_keys        # public SSH key of your ansible machine
* group_vars/szczecin.yml/location_subnet
* group_vars/gitserver.yml/ansible_host     # IP address of your Raspi

### Run Ansible
Having done that you could now start the setup process with (default vault password is 'my_secret_password')
```
ansible-playbook gitserver.yml -i ./hosts --vault-id git@prompt
```

Ansible will now execute the playbook and you can watch while a not to short list of tasks will be finished.
And voil√†, you have a ready to use private Git server. Credentials are as following:
* system account
    * name: link
    * password: my_secret_password
* git account
    * name: git
    * password: my_secret_password

### Setting up a repository on your new server
You might want to actually have some repos on your Git server, lets say you want my ansible-gitserver repo on your private server:
* `ssh link@git` ssh into your Git server with the system account
* `cd ../git/` change into user gits homefolder
* `sudo git clone --bare https://github.com/fex01/ansible-gitserver.git ansible-gitserver.git` we clone the repo with the `--bare` option, for details why let me point you to the relevant chapter of the free online book [Pro Git][git-server]
* `sudo chown -R git:git ansible-gitserver.git` make the user git the owner of this repo
* `exit` end your SSH connection

Now what do we have to do on our ansible machine to use our Git server as remote? Let's have a look at two different options:
* clone a fresh copy of the repo from our private server
    * leave your ansible-gitserver working directory and navigate to where you want the new copy
    * `git clone ssh://git@git/home/git/ansible-gitserver.git ansible-gitserver-private`
    * done, `git push` and `git pull`commands will use your private server as target
* add a second remote to our existing ansible-gitserver working directory
    * `git remote add private ssh://git@git/home/git/ansible-gitserver.git`
    * done, `git remote show` will now show two remotes for this repo, origin & private
    * with `git remote show origin` or `git remote show private` you can test the connection to the remote and see details like the remotes URL

While this test run was nice to see that Ansible actually does the job, **I would strongly counsel against using your new server at it is - you are still using user names & passwords chosen by me**!
Let's have a look at the next chapter to change that.


## Getting Useful
An Ansible based setup process would not be very useful if you couldn't change my default values for stuff like user names, passwords, port numbers, etc. ... - thats where Variables come into play. To understand where to set them, we need some common terms.

### ansible speak
I aim to keep the vocabulary lessons to a minimum, but lets have a look at three key concepts:
#### Inventory
A list of computers managed by Ansible, sorted into groups (details see [Ansible - How to build your inventory][ansible-inventory]).
As example a commented clipping of the 'hosts' file:
    ```
    # file: host
    ...
    [szczecin_gitserver]            # group
    git                             # a managed computer, called host

    [szczecin_raspbian]             # different group
    git                             # same host

    # gitserver in all locations    
    [gitserver:children]            # group of groups
    szczecin_gitserver

    ...

    # everything in szczecin        # different group of groups
    [szczecin:children]
    szczecin_gitserver
    szczecin_raspbian
    ```
#### Playbooks
The previous mentioned repeatable cooking receipts - on which machine(s) do you want to execute which tasks and what are the environment parameters (details see [Ansible - About Playbooks][ansible-playbooks]).
Example: gitserver.yml
    ```yml
    - name: playbook to set up a git server     # name of your play
      hosts: gitserver                          # group of machines to which to apply this play
      gather_facts: false                       # \
      debugger: on_failed                       # - optional parameters
      become: true                              # / 

      tasks:                                    # list of tasks
      - include_role: 
        name: prepare-raspberry
      - include_role: 
        name: gitserver-config
    ```
#### Roles
Instead of writing the same tasks again and again for different playbooks, you can bundle tasks into roles (details see [Ansible - Roles][ansible-roles]). But the biggest advantage of roles is that they are sharable - just have a look at [Ansible Galaxy][ansible-galaxy] to find roles for almost all common tasks.

### Variables
Comming back to variables - while Ansibles knows a number of options where to set them (details see [Ansible - Using Variables][ansible-variables]), the basic option is to link them to machines in your [Inventory](#inventory).



### Going back to Start
What? After having finally a running Git server?
### Customization




## Deep Dive

### Execution Command
Lets start with the command we are executing: `ansible-playbook gitserver.yml -i ./hosts --vault-id git@prompt`
* `ansible-playbook gitserver.yml` execute playbook 'gitserver.yml'
* `-i ./hosts` use the file 'hosts' in the current directory as inventory
* `--vault-id git@prompt` this play has encrypted variables, ask me for the decryption password, password hint is 'git'

### Playbook
So we are executing a playbook, what does it do?
```yml
- name: playbook to set up a git server     # name of your play
  hosts: gitserver                          # group of machines to which to apply this play
  gather_facts: false                       # \
  debugger: on_failed                       # - optional parameters
  become: true                              # / 

  tasks:                                    # list of tasks
  - include_role: 
    name: prepare-raspberry
  - include_role: 
    name: gitserver-config
```
Our playbook should execute two roles with a certain set of variables.

### Role prepare-raspberry

#### Role set-connection-parameters

#### Role provision-root

#### Role rename-user

#### Role rename-host

#### Role arillso.localization

#### Role weareinteractive.apt

#### Role GROG.reboot

#### Role manala.vim

#### Role weareinteractive.users

#### Role ssh-server-config

#### Role weareinteractive.ufw

### Role gitserver-config

#### Role weareinteractive.users - again?

#### Role weareinteractive.git


## Testing








## outlook {#outlook}
* require password for sudo - probably easy, but I still have to find out how to deal with required sudo passwords in Ansible :sweat_smile:
* automate testing -> automate builds (travis?)
* find / create a fitting Raspbian test image for Docker (seems to be non-trivial because of the underlying ARM architecture :thinking:)
* replacing more of my custom roles with public roles from [Ansible Galaxy][ansible-galaxy]
* publishing my surviving roles on [Ansible Galaxy][ansible-galaxy]
    * move each role into it's own repo (necessary for publishing said role)
    * integrate them as dependencies / subrepos into this repo


## Sources
* [Ansible docs][ansible-intro]
* a role which I could not fit exactly to my purpose but which really helped with getting me started: [hannseman.raspbian](https://github.com/hannseman/ansible-raspbian)
* the code from [moodlebox](https://github.com/moodlebox/moodlebox) was quite helpful vor renaming the default user via Ansible
* Ansibles roles repo [Ansible Galaxy](https://galaxy.ansible.com) in general - just have a look into the source code of different roles to learn
* Jeff Geerlings [Testing your Ansible roles with Molecule](https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2018/testing-your-ansible-roles-molecule) (post is from 2028, installation instructions are not up to date, but it helps with getting the concept)

[^ansible-machine]: You can install Ansible on a variety of different Linux distributions or macOS, have a look at the [docs](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/installation_guide/index.html)
[^raspi]: An older model shouldn't be a problem, I just had that one laying around.
[^mounting_point]: Your mounting point for the SD Card might differ
[^etcher]: If you use etcher either disable auto-eject before writing the image or eject and reinsert your SD Card to mount it again.
